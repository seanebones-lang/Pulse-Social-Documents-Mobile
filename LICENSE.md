- **No Modification or Derivative Works**: You may not modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the Content, nor may you integrate any portion of the Content into other software, applications, systems, or projects without explicit, prior written authorization from the Owners.
- **No Distribution or Sharing**: Distribution, transmission, sharing, uploading, posting, or making the Content available to any third party, whether publicly or privately, via any medium (including but not limited to GitHub forks, repositories, cloud storage, email, or physical media) is expressly forbidden.
- **No Use or Implementation**: You are not authorized to use, implement, execute, test, or deploy the Content for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, without a negotiated license agreement executed by Mariam McDonnell on behalf of NextEleven LLC.
- **No Licensing or Sale**: The Content is not for sale, license, sublicense, rental, lease, or any other form of transfer unless explicitly negotiated and agreed upon in writing by Mariam McDonnell, the majority owner of NextEleven LLC. No implied licenses are granted herein.
- **Protection Against Theft and Misappropriation**: This notice serves as formal declaration that any theft, misappropriation, or unauthorized access to the Content, including theft of ideas, code combinations, technological innovations, or any other elements, will be treated as a violation of intellectual property rights under applicable laws.

## Legal Protections and Enforcement
The Content is protected under United States copyright laws (Title 17 of the United States Code), trade secret laws (including the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016), patent laws (if applicable), and international treaties, including but not limited to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). As of December 2025, these protections remain in full force, with enhanced enforcement mechanisms under recent U.S. federal rulings on software IP (e.g., strengthened DMCA anti-circumvention provisions) and international agreements combating digital piracy.

- **Worldwide Jurisdiction**: The Owners reserve the right to enforce these protections worldwide, in any jurisdiction where infringement occurs, including seeking remedies under foreign laws equivalent to U.S. protections, such as the EU Copyright Directive or national IP laws in other countries.
- **Prosecution and Damages**: Any violation of this notice will result in immediate legal action, including but not limited to civil lawsuits for injunctive relief, actual damages, statutory damages (up to $150,000 per willful infringement under U.S. law), punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Criminal prosecution may also be pursued where applicable (e.g., under the Economic Espionage Act for trade secret theft or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for unauthorized access). The Owners will seek the maximum penalties and damages allowed by law in all relevant jurisdictions.
- **Specific Protections Against Cloning and Shady Practices**: In light of emerging technologies such as AI-driven app cloning tools (e.g., those capable of instant replication via code analysis or UI scraping), any such use constitutes willful infringement. Additionally, clients, contractors, or collaborators engaging in shady practices—such as unauthorized sharing, backdoor implementations, or idea poaching—will face breach of contract claims (if applicable), tortious interference suits, and reputational enforcement through public disclosures where legally permissible.
